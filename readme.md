# 🐦 Fleppy Berd

A fun and quirky Pygame-based clone of the classic Flappy Bird game — built entirely with Python and Pygame.

## 👾 How to play
- Decompress the `Game.rar` file using the free `WinRAR` software.<br>
- Open the extracted folder and move the `Game` application inside to the folder where `Assets` is located and then double-click the application to start the game.<br>
- If you want to copy the game to another location on your system, make sure to copy the Assets folder as well. The game requires the Assets folder for proper gameplay.<br>
- The Python file was converted into an executable application using `PyInstaller`.<br>
